# Restaurant application

Small restaurant appliation for frontend bootcamp day5 at school 21.

## start server

Each chapter has it's own packages. They are separated.
But instructions to start the server and the client are the same

```bash
npm install # install dependencies
npm run dev # start the application
```


> [!NOTE]
> in chapter 2 server needs a secret enviroment key. So to start the server run:
> `secret=yoursecret npm run dev`
